## 🏗️ Infrastructure Requirements (Deferred)

### Docker Registry Setup
**Required For:** Docker image storage and deployment
**Prerequisites:**
1. Enable GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io) write permissions
2. Configure package permissions for organization
3. Set up GITHUB_TOKEN with appropriate scopes

**Commands to Enable:**
```bash
# In GitHub repo settings:
# 1. Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions → Read and write permissions
# 2. Settings → Packages → Add repository to package
```

### Kubernetes Cluster Setup
**Required For:** Application deployment
**Prerequisites:**
1. Provision Kubernetes cluster (AKS, EKS, GKE, or local)
2. Configure `kubectl` access
3. Create namespace: `splitsafex-staging`, `splitsafex-production`
4. Set up secrets in GitHub:
   - `STAGING_KUBECONFIG`
   - `PRODUCTION_KUBECONFIG`

### Additional Secrets Required
```bash
# In GitHub repo: Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL           # For deployment notifications
GRAFANA_API_TOKEN          # For monitoring integration
GRAFANA_URL                # Grafana dashboard URL
DEPLOYMENT_TRACKING_URL    # Optional deployment tracking
```

## 📝 Notes

### Architectural Decisions
1. **Validation-Before-Auth Pattern:** Validation middleware runs before authentication on POST routes to provide better error messages (400 instead of 401)
2. **Continue-On-Error Strategy:** Non-critical steps continue on error to prevent blocking the pipeline
3. **AI Service Proxy:** AI controller proxies requests to local AI service (mocked in tests via nock)
4. **Test Environment Bypass:** Rate limiting bypassed in test environment for stability

### Known Issues
1. **203 Test Failures:** Controllers return placeholder data instead of DB-backed responses
2. **Docker Registry:** Missing write permissions for GitHub Container Registry
3. **Kubernetes:** No cluster configured for deployment
4. **AI Service:** Some endpoints require nock mocks in tests

### Recommendations
1. **Enable GitHub Packages:** Critical for Docker image storage
2. **Set Up Test Database:** Use MongoDB in-memory for integration tests (already configured)
3. **Implement DB Operations:** Priority for reducing test failures
4. **Configure Monitoring:** Set up Grafana/Prometheus for production
