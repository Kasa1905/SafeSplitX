# SafeSplitX AI Fraud Detection Implementation

This document provides comprehensive information about the AI-powered fraud detection system implemented for SafeSplitX.

## Overview

The SafeSplitX AI fraud detection system is a multi-layered approach to identifying potentially fraudulent expenses in real-time. It combines machine learning models, rule-based engines, and behavioral analysis to provide accurate fraud detection with minimal false positives.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Fraud Detection Service** (`fraudService.js`)
   - Main orchestration service
   - Coordinates ML and rule-based analysis
   - Manages result storage and alerting

2. **Python ML Service** (FastAPI)
   - Dedicated Python service for ML inference
   - Supports multiple ML models and ensemble methods
   - RESTful API for fraud analysis

3. **Rule Engine** (`ruleEngine.js`)
   - Configurable rule-based fraud detection
   - 8 built-in fraud detection rules
   - Pattern analysis and threshold monitoring

4. **Feature Engineering** (`mlUtils.js`)
   - Extracts features from expense data
   - Supports temporal, user, group, and categorical features
   - Caching for improved performance

5. **Database Models**
   - `FraudAnalysis`: Stores fraud analysis results
   - `FraudAlert`: Manages fraud alerts and notifications
   - `FraudRule`: Configurable fraud detection rules

6. **Middleware Integration**
   - Pre/post expense creation analysis
   - Expense update monitoring
   - Bulk analysis support
   - User behavior analysis

## Features

### Machine Learning Capabilities

- **Ensemble Models**: Combines multiple ML algorithms for better accuracy
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns in expense data
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts 20+ features from expense data
- **Model Versioning**: Tracks model versions and performance
- **Batch Processing**: Supports bulk expense analysis

### Rule-Based Detection

1. **Unusual Amount Detection**: Identifies expenses significantly different from user's history
2. **High Frequency Analysis**: Detects rapid expense creation patterns
3. **Timing Anomalies**: Flags expenses created at unusual times
4. **New User Patterns**: Monitors new users for suspicious behavior
5. **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies potential duplicate expenses
6. **Location Analysis**: Analyzes location-based patterns (optional)
7. **Category Analysis**: Monitors category-specific anomalies
8. **Round Number Detection**: Flags suspiciously round amounts

### Fraud Analysis Pipeline

```
Expense Data → Feature Extraction → ML Analysis + Rule Analysis → Score Combination → Risk Classification → Alert Generation
```

### Risk Classification

- **LOW** (0.0 - 0.3): Minimal fraud risk
- **MEDIUM** (0.3 - 0.7): Moderate fraud risk, monitor
- **HIGH** (0.7 - 0.9): High fraud risk, requires review
- **CRITICAL** (0.9 - 1.0): Critical fraud risk, block transaction

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
